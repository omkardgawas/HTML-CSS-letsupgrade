        <h1>Web Development</h1>
        <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
       
        <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
            It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. 
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. 
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
            HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
            HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. 
            Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>

        <h3>JavaScript and PHP</h3>
        <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. 
            JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. 
            Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
            All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device. As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
            PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. 
            The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.

        <h3>Ruby</h3>
        <p>Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.
            Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection and just-in-time compilation. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. 
            According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, BASIC, and Lisp.</p>
